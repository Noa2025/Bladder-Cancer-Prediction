## Bladder-Cancer-Prediction
Bladder cancer is the 10th most prevalent malignancy globally and the 6th most common cancer in men. The recurrence rate for bladder tumors ranges from 31% to 78% within 5 years. Cystitis (inflammation of the urinary bladder) and bladder cancer are distinct clinical entities, yet their manifestations often overlap, with patients presenting with hematuria, dysuria, and an urgent need to urinate. While cystoscopy remains the standard diagnostic tool, it is minimally invasive but highly uncomfortable for patients. The objective of this project is to analyze routine blood and urine test results to identify biomarkers capable of distinguishing between cystitis, which typically requires only antibiotic treatment, and bladder cancer, which demands a more extensive diagnostic and therapeutic pathway involving imaging, tumor resection, pathological analysis, and sometimes additional treatment modalities.
To achieve this, the project involved comprehensive data cleaning, imputation of missing values, and careful handling of outliers, guided by deep clinical knowledge to ensure biologically meaningful preprocessing. A range of machine learning models was applied, with hyperparameter tuning and feature importance analysis to optimize performance. 
## Key Findings:
* All models achieved high recall (â‰¥0.95), which is crucial in a screening context where missing bladder cancer cases must be avoided.
* The best-performing models (Random Forest and Neural Networks) reached 0.80 accuracy and 0.81 precision, suggesting reliable discrimination between cystitis and bladder cancer using routine lab tests.
* Feature importance analysis identified a panel of demographic, renal, and urine-based features. The final selection combines well-known risk factors such as age, smoking, and hematuria (blood in urine) with renal and metabolic indicators, including estimated GFR, creatinine, potassium, and urine protein. Together, these features provide a compact and clinically feasible panel that balances predictive accuracy with practical applicability for bladder cancer detection.
