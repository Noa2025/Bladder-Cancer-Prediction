# Bladder-Cancer-Prediction
This project leverages data analysis and deep clinical knowledge to create a predictive model that distinguishes between bladder cancer and cystitis. By applying machine learning to routine blood and urine tests, the project identifies a clinically feasible panel of biomarkers with high accuracy and recall, providing a less invasive screening tool.
